    <section name="Hippo CMS Extra Folder Context Menus">
      <p>
        This project provides extra Folder Context Menu items such as 'Copy folder...' and 'Move folder...'
        for Hippo CMS 7 with extendable base implementations for developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to explain this feature is probably to show screenshots.
      </p>

      <img alt="Folder copy and move context menu"
           src="images/foldercpmvmenus.png" />
      <p>After installing this plugin, you will be able to see 'Copy folder...' and 'Move folder...' context menus.</p>

      <img alt="Folder copy dialog"
           src="images/copyfolder1.png" />
      <p>
        In the Folder Copy dialog, you can select the destination folder, folder name and folder URL name.
      </p>

      <img alt="After copying a folder"
           src="images/copyfolder2.png" />
      <p>
        The local links (link nodes under the copied root folder) are automatically
        reset to the corresponding copied nodes under the copied root folder if exists.
      </p>

      <img alt="Folder move dialog"
           src="images/movefolder1.png" />
      <p>
        In the Folder Move dialog, you can select the destination folder, folder name and folder URL name.
      </p>

      <img alt="After moving a folder"
           src="images/movefolder2.png" />
      <p>
        The local links (link nodes under the copied root folder) are not affected by moving
        because all the internal links are based on UUIDs.
      </p>
